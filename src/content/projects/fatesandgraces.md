_Fates & Graces_ was a dance piece which ran over the course of a week in 2022 at [Meanwhile Gallery](https://www.meanwhilegallery.com/#/archive/819) in Wellington, New Zealand.
Featuring 3 dancers in an intimate environment and soundtrack by Jed Prickett & Fredd Marshall.
I collaborated on the look of the dance and created the banner props that decorated the room.

Dancers: Ellen MorganButler, Georgia Beechy and Josiah Gammeter.
