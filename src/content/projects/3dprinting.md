## Polyjet Printing

![scanning for printing](3dprinting/facescans-base.webp)

Face scan targetting the mouth area, scanned on an Artec Spider device.
These scans served as a basis and reference point for various explorations.

![scanning for printing](3dprinting/multiprint-hands.webp)

"Annotated" 3D scan of the area, done as part of a university paper titled "Design Physiology"

![polyjet print 1](3dprinting/multirings_1.webp)

3D Printed rings, built on the Stratasys J750 full colour printer.

## FDM Printing

These are sculptural explorations done based on the 3D face scan, in which the wider scan was repaired by mirroring and manually resculpting the face.
