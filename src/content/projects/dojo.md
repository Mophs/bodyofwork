## Twisted Frequency — 10 year anniversary, 2024/25

In 2024 and 2025 I supported the Dojo stage at the Twisted Frequency music festival, organising the video wall art install and creating the Resolume mappings for VJs to perform on.
The mapping was done in collaboration with Tim Caldwell ([Tim Caldwell](https://cyberboy666.com/)) who graciously provided the HDMI splitter hardware.

My key operational role was onboarding artists on the stages setup and providing on-call technical support.
I also performed visuals as part of the project YOLKCLUB, with [Grace Bella](https://www.gracebella.co.nz/) and [Peregrin Hyde](https://www.perescope.co.nz/), as well as a solo VJ set.

## Twisted Frequency 9 — 2023/24

The 2024 stage was defined by the TV wall, reclaimed from recyling centers and setup to provide a pseudo-projection surface.
